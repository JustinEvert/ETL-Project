(iii) Data for monthly National level Inflation Rates for Mexico (2016 - present). Data EXTRACTED from INEGI in HTML format

TRANSFORM:

(i) Pandas used to:
- CONSOLIDATE 8 files into 1 Dataset 
- TRANSFORM consolidated data into Dataframe
- CLEAN data and SELECT target categories
- SAVE transformed and cleaned data to CSV & IPYNB formats
- EXPORT finished Dataframe to PostGres

(ii) Pandas used to: 
- TRANFORM data EXTRACTED from API into Dataframe
- CLEAN data and SELECT target categories
- SAVE transformed and cleaned data to IPYNB format
- EXPORT finished Dataframe to PostGres

(iii) Pandas used to: 
- TRANFORM HTML data EXTRACTED from INEGI into Dataframe
- CLEAN data and SELECT target categories
- SAVE transformed and cleaned data to IPYNB format
- EXPORT finished Dataframe to PostGres

LOAD:
- TABLES were created in Postgres to receive all datasets once transformation process completed
- Once dataset transformation completed all data was exported and LOADED to PostGres meaning all created tables were populated with the datasets which correlated to them
- JOINS were then used to CONSOLIDATE the 3 seperate datasets into one datestes which included the addition of targetted information
- All LOADED data saved to SQL format
